# CICD implementation of the 3 microservices project onto and EKS cluster and onto a non-EKS cluster using GitLab with properly authenticated user gitlab for kops (non-EKS) and IAM user gitlab2 for EKS for provisioning

## Tools
GitLab

AWS EKS (using Cloudformation stack) and IAM user role provisioning.  For this we need to supply gitlab with the IAM AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as well as the kubeconfig file contents in the ENV vars for the project. Provisioning will be through the gitlab2 IAM user 

non-EKS implementation will use kops and create the CA cert, public cert and private cert so that the kube config file can be created to access the cluster. For this, gitlab needs to be supplied with the kubeconfig contents in the ENV vars for the project.
